# My Role
I am responsible for coordinating tasks, keeping track of deadlines, and making sure the group stays on track.
Our project is a universal scanner app designed to scan barcodes from major retail stores in Canada and the U.S. Once a barcode is scanned, the app displays detailed information about the item. This app improves efficiency by eliminating the need for customers to download multiple store-specific scanning apps.
