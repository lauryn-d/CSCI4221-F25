# Cameron's Role
My objective is to implement smaller features within the developement of the tangible product or software. During the development of our product, I must run test and report bugs to ensure quality. Through this process i must ask clarifying question to make sure things are developing and working as intended. 

# Our Product
Our project is a universal scanner app designed to scan barcodes from major retail stores in Canada and the U.S. Once a barcode is scanned, the app displays detailed information about the item. This app improves efficiency by eliminating the need for customers to download multiple store-specific scanning apps.
