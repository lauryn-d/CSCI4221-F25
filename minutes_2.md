## Discussion Points
- Redo Project Part 2
- We must separate files from the minutes, prototype, product vision, etc.
- - We need to reorganize and separate the files for this part of the project. Specifically, documents such as the meeting minutes, prototype, product vision, and any other related materials should each be placed in their own clearly labeled folders or files. This separation will make the project easier to navigate, ensure clarity during review, and help maintain a structured format for submission and collaboration.

## Technical Challenges Encountered
- We experienced difficulties with the features not displaying correctly on the device. While attempting to troubleshoot the issue using AI assistance, the computer froze, which interrupted our progress and prevented further testing at that time.
