## Discussion Points
- Drafted the product vision statement for our Calendar and Budget Management App.
- Identify three categories of users, i.e., personas for my software. 
- Plan to make login screen for app
- Reviewed the PBI & Sprint Table.
Identified and discussed three main issues:
- Product Information: Users need to have accurate product information
- Perfomance Limitations: Relying on React Native framework may lead to slower performance
- User Experience Inconsistency: Different platforms have different design expectations. A "one-size-fits-all" design can feel unnatural or confusing to users who expect native look and feel.

Selected a feature to prototype: login and/or menu screen
Planned to make login for consumers can securely access the applicaton.
